//!
//! ## Description
//!
//! Turn a query into a changefeed, an infinite stream of objects representing changes to the
//! query’s results as they occur. A changefeed may return changes to a table or an individual
//! document (a “point” changefeed). Commands such as `filter` or `map` may be used before the `changes`
//! command to transform or filter the output, and many commands that operate on sequences can be
//! chained after `changes`.
//!
//! You may specify one of six optional arguments:
//!
//! * `squash`: Controls how change notifications are batched. Acceptable values are `true`,
//! `false` and a numeric value:
//!     * `true`: When multiple changes to the same document occur before a batch of notifications
//!     is sent, the changes are “squashed” into one change. The client receives a notification
//!     that will bring it fully up to date with the server.
//!     * `false`: All changes will be sent to the client verbatim. This is the default.
//!     * `n`: A numeric value (floating point). Similar to `true`, but the server will wait `n`
//!     seconds to respond in order to squash as many changes together as possible, reducing
//!     network traffic. The first batch will always be returned immediately.
//! * `changefeed_queue_size`: the number of changes the server will buffer between client reads
//! before it starts dropping changes and generates an error (default: 100,000).
//! * `include_initial`: if `true`, the changefeed stream will begin with the current contents of the
//! table or selection being monitored. These initial results will have `new_val` fields, but no
//! `old_val` fields. The initial results may be intermixed with actual changes, as long as an
//! initial result for the changed document has already been given. If an initial result for a
//! document has been sent and a change is made to that document that would move it to the unsent
//! part of the result set (e.g., a changefeed monitors the top 100 posters, the first 50 have been
//! sent, and poster 48 has become poster 52), an “uninitial” notification will be sent, with an
//! `old_val` field but no `new_val` field.
//! * `include_states`: if `true`, the changefeed stream will include special status documents
//! consisting of the field `state` and a string indicating a change in the feed’s state. These
//! documents can occur at any point in the feed between the notification documents described
//! below. If `include_states` is `false` (the default), the status documents will not be sent.
//! * `include_offsets`:  if `true`, a changefeed stream on an `order_by.limit` changefeed will include
//! `old_offset` and `new_offset` fields in status documents that include `old_val` and `new_val`. This
//! allows applications to maintain ordered lists of the stream’s result set. If `old_offset` is set
//! and not `null`, the element at `old_offset` is being deleted; if `new_offset` is set and not `null`,
//! then `new_val` is being inserted at `new_offset`. Setting `include_offsets` to `true` on a changefeed
//! that does not support it will raise an error.
//! * `include_types`: if `true`, every result on a changefeed will include a `type` field with a
//! string that indicates the kind of change the result represents: `add`, `remove`, `change`, `initial`,
//! `uninitial`, `state`. Defaults to `false`.
//!
//! There are currently two states:
//!
//! * `{state: 'initializing'}` indicates the following documents represent initial values on the
//! feed rather than changes. This will be the first document of a feed that returns initial
//! values.
//! * `{state: 'ready'}` indicates the following documents represent changes. This will be the
//! first document of a feed that does `not` return initial values; otherwise, it will indicate the
//! initial values have all been sent.
//!
//! If the table becomes unavailable, the changefeed will be disconnected, and a runtime exception
//! will be thrown by the driver.
//!
//! Changefeed notifications take the form of a two-field object:
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!     "old_val": <document before change>,
//!     "new_val": <document after change>
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! When `include_types` is `true`, there will be three fields:
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!     "old_val": <document before change>,
//!     "new_val": <document after change>,
//!     "type": <result type>
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! When a document is deleted, `new_val` will be `None`; when a document is inserted, `old_val` will be
//! `None`.
